Let's perform a dry run of the provided code for the input arr1 = {2, 3, 4, 5, 7}.

Initial Array:
makefile
Copy code
arr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
total_cost = 0
First Iteration:
Find Minimum and Maximum Elements:

min_element_it = min_element(arr.begin(), arr.end()) -> min_element = 2
max_element_it = max_element(arr.begin(), arr.end()) -> max_element = 7
Calculate the Cost:

cost = ceil(static_cast<double>(min_element + max_element) / (max_element - min_element + 1))
cost = ceil((2 + 7) / (7 - 2 + 1))
cost = ceil(9 / 6) = 2
Remove Min and Max Elements:

Remove 7 (index 4), then remove 2 (index 0 after removal of 7):
arr = [3, 4, 5]
Add Their Sum Back to the Array:

arr.push_back(2 + 7)
arr = [3, 4, 5, 9]
Update Total Cost:

total_cost = 0 + 2 = 2
Second Iteration:
Find Minimum and Maximum Elements:

min_element = 3
max_element = 9
Calculate the Cost:

cost = ceil((3 + 9) / (9 - 3 + 1))
cost = ceil(12 / 7) = 2
Remove Min and Max Elements:

Remove 9 (index 3), then remove 3 (index 0 after removal of 9):
arr = [4, 5]
Add Their Sum Back to the Array:

arr.push_back(3 + 9)
arr = [4, 5, 12]
Update Total Cost:

total_cost = 2 + 2 = 4
Third Iteration:
Find Minimum and Maximum Elements:

min_element = 4
max_element = 12
Calculate the Cost:

cost = ceil((4 + 12) / (12 - 4 + 1))
cost = ceil(16 / 9) = 2
Remove Min and Max Elements:

Remove 12 (index 2), then remove 4 (index 0 after removal of 12):
arr = [5]
Add Their Sum Back to the Array:

arr.push_back(4 + 12)
arr = [5, 16]
Update Total Cost:

total_cost = 4 + 2 = 6
Fourth Iteration:
Find Minimum and Maximum Elements:

min_element = 5
max_element = 16
Calculate the Cost:

cost = ceil((5 + 16) / (16 - 5 + 1))
cost = ceil(21 / 12) = 2
Remove Min and Max Elements:

Remove 16 (index 1), then remove 5 (index 0 after removal of 16):
arr = []
Add Their Sum Back to the Array:

arr.push_back(5 + 16)
arr = [21]
Update Total Cost:

total_cost = 6 + 2 = 8
Final State:
The array has been reduced to a single element.
total_cost = 8
Output:
