-- Step 1: Initialize @sql to NULL
SET @sql = NULL;

-- Step 2: Generate the dynamic SQL based on distinct state names
SELECT
  GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT
    CONCAT(
      'SUM(CASE WHEN state = ''',
      state,
      ''' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS `',
      state, 'Sales`'
    )
  ) INTO @sql
FROM state_sales;

-- Step 3: Append the SQL to the main SELECT query
SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT ', @sql, ' FROM state_sales');
-- Step 4: Display the dynamically generated SQL (optional, for debugging purposes)
SELECT @sql;
-- Step 5: Prepare and execute the dynamically generated query
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
EXECUTE stmt;
-- Step 6: Deallocate the prepared statement
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
